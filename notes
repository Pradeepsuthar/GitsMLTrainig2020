-> What is Machine Learning?
-> Machine Learning is a subset of artificial intelligence. it focues mainly on the designing systems, there by allowing them to lern and make      predictions based on some experience which in data is case of machines.
    -> Artificial Intelligence : A Technique which enables machines to mimic human behaviour.
    -> Machine Lerning : Machine Learning is subset of AI technique which is use staticals methods to enable machines to improve with experience.
    -> Deep Learning : It is a subset of ML which make the computation of multi-layer neural network feasible.

-> Types of Machine Learning : 
    1. Supervised Learning
    2. Unsupervised Learning
    3. Reinforcement Learning

1. Supervised Learning: 
    ex : Supervised Algorithms is used in Cortana application in windows, Weather applications, Biometric applications, Banking sector, Medical sector, Retail sector etc.

    Supervised Lerning Algorithms:
    1. Linear Regression Algorithm
    2. Random Forest Algorithm
    3. Support Vector Machines Algorithm

2. Unsupervised Learning: 

    Unsupervised Learning Algorithms:
    1. Apriori Algorithm
    2. K-Means Algorithm
    3. Hirechial Algorithm

math(Numpy, Theano, Scipy)

numpy is use mostly create arry
[i for in dir(np) if 'arr' in i]

tools : SAS, tabule, app dynamic, graphan, data briks

Data visualization py-lib: awaborn, matplatlib, glpot, plotly
